plugintest - dynamic loader example
Colin King <cking@m202.net>

This is a small demonstration of Unix-style dynamic loading. This is a powerful
feature of the C library that allows you to write and load plugins into your
applications. There are many ways to do this through frameworks, but this seems
to be the simplest.

This compiles in Linux and possibly FreeBSD.
